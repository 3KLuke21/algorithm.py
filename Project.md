# Employee Access Management Script

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to automate the management of employee access to restricted content in a healthcare environment. The goal is to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive patient data by controlling access based on IP addresses. There is an allow list that contains the IP addresses of employees who are authorized to access the restricted subnetwork, and a remove list that specifies which employees must be removed from this list. The algorithm developed checks for any IP addresses in the remove list that are also present in the allow list, and removes them accordingly. This process helps maintain the integrity of access control systems.

## Open the file that contains the allow list

In this step, we need to open the file containing the allow list. The file is named allow_list.txt. In Python, this is done using the with statement, which ensures the file is properly opened and closed. The file name is stored in a variable, import_file, and the file is opened in read mode to work with it. The with statement handles the file, automatically closing it when the block of code is completed.

### Python Syntax:

```python
import_file = "allow_list.txt"
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    # Code to work with the file will go here
```

## Read the file contents

Once the file is opened, we use the .read() method to retrieve the contents of the file and store them in a variable called ip_addresses. This method converts the entire content of the file into a string, making it easy to manipulate further.

### Python Syntax:

```python
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    ip_addresses = file.read()
```

## Convert the string into a list

After reading the file contents as a string, we need to convert this string into a list of IP addresses for easier processing. To do this, we use the .split() method, which splits the string at each line break (\n) and returns a list. Each element in the list will represent a separate IP address.

### Python Syntax:

```python
ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split("\n")
```

## Iterate through the remove list

Next, we need to iterate through the remove_list, which contains the IP addresses that need to be removed from the allow list. We will use a for loop to go through each IP address in the remove list and check if it is present in the ip_addresses list.

### Python Syntax:

```python
remove_list = ["192.168.1.2", "192.168.1.3"]  # Example list
for element in remove_list:
    # Code to remove element will go here
```

## Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list

Inside the loop, we add a conditional statement to check if the current IP address (element) is in the ip_addresses list. If it is, we use the .remove() method to delete it from the list. The .remove() method removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the list.

It is important to note that this works because there are no duplicates in the ip_addresses list, so we don’t need to worry about removing the same IP address multiple times.

### Python Syntax:

```python
for element in remove_list:
    if element in ip_addresses:
        ip_addresses.remove(element)
```

## Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses

Once the necessary IP addresses are removed from the list, we need to update the allow_list.txt file with the revised list. First, we convert the list back into a string using the .join() method, separating each IP address with a newline character (\n). Then, we use the with statement again, but this time in write mode ("w") to overwrite the file with the updated list.

### Python Syntax:

```python
ip_addresses = "\n".join(ip_addresses)  # Convert list back to string with new lines
with open(import_file, "w") as file:
    file.write(ip_addresses)
```

## Summary

This Python algorithm automates the process of updating an allow list for a healthcare company to control employee access to sensitive patient data. It opens the file containing the list of authorized IP addresses and checks for any IPs on the remove list. The algorithm then removes any IP addresses found in both lists and updates the allow list file with the revised content. By leveraging Python’s file handling and list manipulation methods, this script efficiently ensures that only the current authorized employees have access to the restricted content. The result is a streamlined and secure process for maintaining access control in compliance with healthcare data protection regulations.
